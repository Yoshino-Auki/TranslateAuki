$53$With the current being what it is, I'm confident that this sealed message will float back to the Helonia Coast.

$53$So Fuya, are you behaving yourself?
$53$I'm guessing you still like to sneak off to the coast searching for seashells, because every time I come home there's a new bottle of shells on the window sill. You're a naughty girl... but I still love you!

$53$Ayna, please take good care of our kid. I'll be back in no time.|
14969|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day 13 at sea.
$53$Everything's going swimmingly, so to speak. I'm not sure this will reach you but what the heck, I'm writing it anyway.

$53$Ayna, thanks for holding down the fort at home while I'm out at sea.
$53$I know that I leave you alone with Fuya a little more often than our marriage counselor would advise, by what can a man do? I'm a merchant, this is what I do for a living.
$53$Anyways, I want you to know that I'm grateful for your sacrifices. Please don't give up on me.

$53$I'll find what I'm looking for this time. You can count on it!|
14970|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day 58 at sea.
$53$The crew are starting to act a bit... strange. One fellow made a marriage proposal to the captain's parrot; for what it's worth, the parrot replied, "I do."

$53$I asked him why he would ever want to marry a parrot.

$53$"For the company," he said. Some company that is! I can't believe I'm on the same ship as this circus of deranged sailors.

$53$Then again, if our information from the Makar is accurate then I should be back home soon.

$53$Ayna, I miss you.|
14971|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day 107 at sea.
$53$This is the third time in a row that we've come up short on our search efforts. Disappointment has given way to concern, and concern is quickly giving way to panic.
$53$I don't care, I'm determined to find the secret potion! If only we'd brought that GPS unit... damn it! 

$53$Ayna, please look after our child.
$53$I'll find the potion. I promise.|
14972|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day 136 at sea.
$53$We're thoroughly lost. I could kick myself for not bringing the GPS, or at least a good old map and compass.
$53$Last night we experienced a violent storm. Some of the crew panicked and offloaded into a life boat, which promptly went under. I had used some of its planks as firewood a few weeks back, so it might be my fault but they should've known better. One man strangled himself to death trying to put on a life vest. Also, the parrot is gone.
$53$The sea here is strangely transparent and luminous. Far below we can see fish as big as buses, glowing in the dark.
$53$If only I were an ichthyologist!

$53$I suspect these fish are somehow connected to the potion.
$53$There is still hope.|
14973|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day 193 at sea.

$53$Thoughts of the homestead fill my mind, I can't stop thinking about it. The TV. Microwave dinners. Abundant toilet paper. High-speed Internet!
$53$The day I left, you said that it was over between us. I thought you meant you wanted to live apart, but now I know you were sending me to my death.

$53$We ran out of food recently. No more cup o' noodles or cheese crackers. Nothing. Pretty soon we'll start eating each other, there's no doubt. I have my eye on the portly man from Manchester.

$53$At least I have the potion. It's the only way to bring Fuya back to health.

$53$I must get back!|
14974|Shade's Message in a Bottle|$53$Day... at sea...

$53$...I love you... forever...

$53$I'm on Fake Island. The nautical coordinates are 12.3456, 78.9012.|
14979|Lovell's Message in a Bottle|$53$Fake Island. Nautical coordinates 12.3456, 78.9012. Nothing here! Not a recommended holiday destination.

$53$Signed, Baron Lovell III.|
14980|Lovell's Message in a Bottle|$53$Fake Island may be a desolate spot, but it has its hidden delights.
$53$Legend has it that somewhere on Fake Island, located at nautical coordinates 12.3456, 78.9012, there is a priceless treasure, some kind of potion that can give eternal life.
$53$Adventurers, this is your time! Step forward and rescue me, and you'll be rewarded with untold riches.

$53$Yours, Baron Lovell III.|
14981|Lovell's Message in a Bottle|$53$Okay, listen up everyone. I buried the treasure right here on this island so it's first come, first serve.
$53$P.S.: I'm on Fake Island. The nautical coordinates are 12.3456, 78.9012.

$53$- Baron Lovell III.|
14982|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$Darnique, you were right all along.
$53$After that embarrassing episode with the banana and the shower curtain, I think it might be a good idea for us to spend some time apart.

$53$Your father certainly won't forgive me any time soon. Even if I promised never to go near his fruit bowl again, I don't think he would trust me.

$53$Instead, I decided to head out into the world to test my mettle. I promise to return as a new man... one who is worthy of your adoration.|
14983|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$Dear Darnique, memories of you haunt my sleep. When I close my eyes, all I see is you. There's nothing I can do about it except to pour the contents of my heart into this bottled letter.

$53$Today I successfully completed my first transaction. No, darling, I didn't sell the engagement ring; it was something more... expendable. In any case, the deal earned me a hundred gold bones!
$53$That should be enough to fund my traveling habit and the remainder of this trip.

$53$I will return as a king among men!|
14984|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$Woe is me! Why do the gods torment me so! My stash is gone and the money with it.

$53$The riches I had acquired through peddling my... well never mind how I got it, they were purloined by a burlesque trapeze artist! Never again will I invite circus performers from Mozambique into my boudoir.

$53$Darnique! I miss you!|
14985|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$Dearest Darnique, the plot thickens. No, it positively curdles! Today I fished a bottle out from the ocean, thinking it was one of my deliriously sensual love letters to you, my sweet Darnique. Lo and behold, it was a message from an aristocrat who is apparently stranded on a deserted island and promising half his fortune to the first man to rescue him!

$53$I suspect the whole thing is a scam, though. After all, his island is called "Fake Island"... but hey, what if it's actually true? In that case this nobleman would be withering away out there. The poor shmuck!

$53$Darnique, I don't know if I can trust this man.|
14986|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$Never lose faith. Every day is a new miracle.

$53$The trapeze artist returned with my cash!

$53$Not only that, she doubled the money at a casino in Monte Carlo and is sharing the proceeds with me, since I was her original "sponsor". Praised be the burlesque entertainers of Mozambique!

$53$We are now officially going into business together.

$53$My dreams are so close now, I can feel it.|
14987|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$The trapeze artist said she was going to perform at a wedding in your village. You're not getting married to another man, are you?! I hope you've forgiven me for that episode with the banana and shower curtain.

$53$I miss you.

$53$You'll wait for me Darnique, won't you? I'm a real man now! I even started shaving regularly.|
14988|Nerk's Message in a Bottle|$53$You're not gonna believe this. Acting as manager and impresario for the circus, I've managed to amass a multi-million dollar fortune! Darnique, it's time for me to come home.

$53$Not long ago, I received news of your marriage. Well, let me send you news of mine. The trapeze artist and I were recently betrothed to each other. She's teaching me how to use the trapeze so that we can perform a double act.

$53$Sometimes we're joined by others from the circus. She calls it swinging.

$53$I'm a very, very happy man.|
14989|Alishanda's Message in a Bottle|$53$I am Alishanda. You may have heard my name before, since the world isn't exactly teeming with electronic DJs turned lepidopterists. That's the study of butterflies, in case you're wondering.

$53$Butterflies have always been a private obsession of mine. Now that I'm a little too old to hit the decks every night, I've decided to indulge in a bit of traveling research.

$53$The following is a paper I plan on publishing in a nature magazine next month.|
14990|Alishanda's Message in a Bottle|$53$"My ship, piloted by two Burmese students on their way to Las Vegas, came across an island in the foamy Indian ocean.

$53$I waded ashore with my butterfly net, leaving the duo to play Mahjong and fish for shrimp.

$53$The first thing I saw on the beach was a gigantic lizard licking its front feet and belching resonantly. I've seen the Godzilla movies, so I knew things could turn sour at any moment.

$53$When the lizard spotted me, it sent a belch in my general direction but refrained from attacking. Instead, it went back to licking its feet in what I can only assume was some form of reptilian manicure.|
14991|Alishanda's Message in a Bottle|$53$I didn't find myself in any immediate danger, so I sat down in the sand and took out my packed lunch.

$53$I was chowing down on the second rice snack when a gigantic butterfly with a fifteen-foot wing span fluttered out of the jungle and onto the beach.

$53$Instinctively, I grabbed my net.|
14992|Alishanda's Message in a Bottle|$53$The lizard and the butterfly must have some ancient feud going on, because what ensued was a battle surreal enough to be worthy of Japanese daytime television.

$53$The lizard attacked with its tongue, using it like a lasso, while the butterfly dropped payloads of toxic pollen into the lizard's eyes.

$53$I set aside my net and cracked open a beer instead. If there had been a bookie on hand, my money would've been on the butterfly.|
14993|Alishanda's Message in a Bottle|$53$Early the next morning, I woke to find the lizard and butterfly still at it. What an epic scuffle!

$53$It wasn't until the ship horn sounded from across the bay that I realized the Burmese students were fixing to set sail without me. I quickly sketched the butterfly on the back of the beer label and headed for ship.

$53$"To be submitted for peer review." - Alishanda|
14994|Yawey's Message in a Bottle|$53$Lately I've noticed that my brother, Alishanda, has been running off to the beach late at night. I thought he might be falling back in with the rave crowd and drug scene, so I followed him just in case.

$53$What I discovered is that he had stuffed a draft paper on butterflies for "Nature" magazine into a bottle and tossed it to the sea. I couldn't make head or tail of it.

$53$I'm writing this message and sending it afloat to try and fathom the logic behind his actions.

$53$Meanwhile, it doesn't look like he's going to let me in on his little secret.|
14995|Yawey's Message in a Bottle|$53$Today I followed my brother to the beach again and found yet another bottle.

$53$I thought it was my brother's, so I opened it after making sure no one was watching. It turns out to be a treasure map of Fake Island!

$53$I really hit the jackpot with this one. It's time to pack my bags and get rich!|
